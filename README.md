# Apollo Kotlin MockServer

MockServer is a HTTP server for your tests. 

MockServer was initially designed for Apollo Kotlin requirements on having a mockserver that supports KMP and websockets.

The API is very minimal. HTTPS and HTTP2/3 are not supported. Performance is a non-goal.

* Do not use for production APIs.
* Do not use in libraries.
